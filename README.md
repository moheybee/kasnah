Automatic and real-time crisis resource suggestions for users of community software (e.g.vBulletin): email, IM, text message (only for veterans or those who know veterans at this time) or phone (potentially free through an online phone service). The goal is to make this available for as many community platforms as possible in the most efficient way without over-promising or creating unrealistic expectations and working with existing research, experts in field and crisis clinics themselves.
